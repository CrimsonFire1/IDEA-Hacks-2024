# IDEA-Hacks-2024
"Go Save Grass" is an interactive game that centers around the user putting out randomly appearing fires. Designed much like an arcade game, a joystick and arcade button is used to control the flow of water and to shoot it at the fire panels.

This project was created for UCLA's IDEA Hacks in 2024. It was a solo project that was started and completed in less than 36 hours.

Arduino code can be found in the software branch.

CAD and laser cut files for the frame can be found in the cad-and-laser-cut-files branch.

Pictures and videos can be found in the pictures-and-videos branch.
